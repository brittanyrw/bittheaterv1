# Features

## Reviews

Visitors can view public reviews filtered by major categories such as broadway, off-broadway, Washington, D.C based shows, musicals and plays. Users with accounts can post reviews by chosing from a list of prepopulated shows. There is also an option for users to mark their reviews as private.

## Show Lists
Visitors can view public showlists by recently created lists, wish lists and trip lists. There are three types of lists that users can create. Main lists for favorites or annual lists of shows, Wishlists for shows that users would like to see and Trip lists for lists of shows to see on a particular vacation.

## Badges
Users can earn badges by posting reviews, creating showlists and seeing shows. In future versions, additional badges will be added. Visitors may also suggest badges via a suggestion form on the main Badge page.
